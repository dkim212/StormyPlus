# StormyPlus
A simple weather app.

StormyPlus (or Stormy+) is a weather app based off of Ben Jakuben's weather app, Stormy.
This app displays data from forecast.io, a free weather service.
It includes new user interface features and a slightly more pleasant GUI.

Features included:
- Current Location based weather (from your phone's GPS)
- A 24 hour weather watch
- An actual non-static background (pretty!)
- Various temperature data, wind speed, humidity, precip. chance, general summary of weather
