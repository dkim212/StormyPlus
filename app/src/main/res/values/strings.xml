    <string name="about">"Stormy+ is a student-made improvement over Ben Jakuben's weather app, Stormy. \n"
            "This app provides basic weather data to the user, provided by forecast.io's weather API. \n"
            "New features have been added, including a nicer UI, current location feature, and wind speed. \n"
            "\n"
            "Things of note:\n"
            "Wind speed is measured by meters per second. \n"
            "All data is pulled from forecast.io, via the website's developer API.\n"
